# Setup

Clone or copy this repository to `~/.pi/agent`, then install its dependencies:

```sh
cd ~/.pi/agent
npm install
```

## fd and rg tools

The `file-search` extension registers `fd` and `rg` as model tools. No setup is normally needed: at startup it silently uses a system-installed `fd` (or `fdfind` on Debian/Ubuntu) and `rg` when available, or an existing fallback binary in `~/.pi/agent/bin/`. Only when neither exists does it download an official release binary (macOS/Linux, arm64/x64, over HTTPS) into `~/.pi/agent/bin/` and show a one-time notification. If your platform is unsupported, install `fd` and `rg` with your package manager and restart pi.

## Theme

Configure Pi to follow the terminal's light/dark appearance in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` while keeping your existing settings:

```json
{
  "theme": "kaku-light/catppuccin-macchiato"
}
```

The value is `light-theme/dark-theme`. Pi loads the themes on its next start, queries the terminal background, and follows color-scheme changes while it is running.
